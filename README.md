# DNAC_API_PROGRAM
This is a repo for a beta program to simplify DNAC API use

## Language
Python

## MVP
Create a program to login ( after submission for school the login/registration will be removed as it is unecessary except for school requirements)  and display a dashboard with the ability to input the ip or FQDN for you DNA center appliance. There will be 1 button starting out for 'Templates' later expanding to eventually inclue all APIs availible to DNAC. The program will automatically authenticate to DNAC and pull the x-auth-token and place it in all the subsequesnt api calls. It will provide a simple interface for pulling template information and deploying templates.

### Future additions
A button option for every applicable API DNA center offers and associated detail and interaction pages.
